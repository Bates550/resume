Software Engineer with 8 years of experience working on highly interactive, browser-based applications. Passionate about pushing the boundaries of what can be done in a web browser.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer (BIM) - Procore Technologies - _August 2021 - Present_

- Worked on a BIM model viewer using a custom WebGL rendering engine (originally based off of three.js) released as a [Javascript package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@procore/bim-webviewer-sdk) consumed by first, second, and third-parties.
- Improved perceived performance of our realtime, iterative rendering algorithm, balancing the need to load arbitrarily large model files (500k-1M faces) with usable framerates and minimal dropout.
- Delivered features for navigating, manipulating, and interrogating BIM models using three.js math utilities.
- Introduced unit testing techniques (karma, jasmine), automated performance benchmarking (node/fs, cypress), and higher quality expectations to the team to reduce incidents.
- Implemented, socialized, and automated a [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)-based release process.
- Quickly implemented prototypes with JS/CSS/HTML to bring technical clarity to projects when scope was ambiguous.
- Reduced development feedback cycle time by enhancing our local development environment to be able to test features locally rather than requiring deployment to a staging server (JS/CSS/HTML, CORS, OAuth).
- Worked with engineers to standardize schemas for storing BIM data coming from multiple file formats (nwd, rvt, ifc, dwg) so that they can be consistently consumed by model viewers across web, iOS, and Android.

### Software Engineer (Financials) - Procore Technologies - _March 2016 - August 2021_

- Built a highly-configurable web app (React/Redux) from the ground up used for managing budget and running financial reports for $100M+ construction projects with 1,000s of line items.
- Worked closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers under tight deadlines.
- Designed and iterated on REST APIs with server-side engineers.
- Consolidated multiple financial table implementations (in React, jquery, ERB, and all permutations) into a single React backed by Rails implementation.
- Onboarded both senior and junior engineers as well as contractors with 10+ hour time difference.

### UX Research Engineer Intern - Procore Technologies - _January 2016 - March 2016_

- Quickly build and iterate on UI prototypes wireframe mocks to use in user testing.
- Fix bugs in HTML forms with JS, CSS, and ERB in a large Ruby on Rails app.

### Web Developer Intern - Laughlin Design Studio - _July 2015 - December 2015_

- Took 90% done projects and bent Wordpress themes to my will to implement final tweaks with JS/CSS.
