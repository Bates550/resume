Software Engineer with 8 years of experience working on highly interactive, browser-based applications.

Passionate about pushing the boundaries of what can be done in a web browser.

Strive for excellence, but be pragmatic. Don't cut corners: cut scope. And NEVER\* speak in absolutes.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer (BIM) - Procore Technologies - _August 2021 - Present_

- Worked on a BIM model viewer using a custom WebGL rendering engine (originally based off of three.js) released as a [Javascript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@procore/bim-webviewer-sdk) consumed by first, second, and third-parties.
- Improved perceived performance of our realtime, iterative rendering algorithm, balancing the need to load arbitrarily large model files (500k-1M faces) with usable framerates and minimal dropout.
- Delivered features for navigating, manipulating, and interrogating BIM models
- Faced with incidents, gradually introduced unit testing techniques, automated performance benchmarking, and manual testing expecations to the team
- Implemented, socialized, and automated a [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)-based release process
- Faced with ambiguous requirements and busy stakeholders, quickly implemented prototypes to nail down scope and work towards better definitions of done and working products.
- Reduced development feedback cycle time by enhancing our local development environment to be able to test features locally rather than requiring deployment to a staging server.
- Worked with engineers to standardize schemas for storing BIM data coming from multiple file formats so that they can be consistently consumed by model viewers on multiple platforms (web and mobile).
- Honed team processes to emphasize communication and make sure we're solving the right problems and heading in consistent directions.

### Software Engineer (Financials) - Procore Technologies - _March 2016 - August 2021_

- Worked with product managers, designers, and other engineers to build a highly-configurable browser app from the ground up used for managing budget and running financial reports for $100M+ construction projects with 1,000s of line items (React)
- Developed API contracts with server-side engineers that let us move quickly and independently

### UX Research Engineer Intern - Procore Technologies - _January 2016 - March 2016_

- Quickly build and iterate on UI prototypes (from designer-provided wireframe mocks) to used in user testing.

### Web Developer Intern - Laughlin Design Studio - _July 2015 - December 2015_

- Took 90% done projects by the owner and bent Wordpress themes to my will implement final tweaks with JS/CSS hackery.
